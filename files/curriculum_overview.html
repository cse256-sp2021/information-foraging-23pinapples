      <h1>Curriculum Overview</h1>
      <p>
        At Washington University Nursery School, we believe that children are unique individuals with
        their own patterns and timetables for social, emotional, intellectual, and physical development.
        We support and encourage their development through our child-centered, process-oriented, playbased 
        curriculum built on Constructivist theories and practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        A thorough explanation of Washington University Nursery School’s
        philosophy and educational practices including intellectual development (language, math, science
        social studies), physical development (gross motor, fine motor), and visual arts
        may be found in the

      <div id="Visual" class="tabcontent">
        <h2>Visual Arts</h2>
        <p>
          At Washington University Nursery School we offer children many opportunities to express
          themselves creatively and artistically. We value visual arts, music, and dramatic play as
          important building blocks in constructing learning. In the visual arts, the emphasis is on the
          process of exploring materials and how they can be manipulated, rather than the product of those
          manipulations. We allow children the time, space, and freedom necessary to achieve a
          successful and complete experience. These art experiences, whether undertaken independently
          or as part of a group, can help increase a child’s attention span, improve fine motor skills,
          strengthen confidence and emotional well-being while building independence. Materials and
          experiences include:
          <ul>
            <li>Drawing with crayons, pencils, chalk, markers, sidewalk chalk</li>
            <li>Painting with fingers, brushes, feathers, sponges, leaves, vegetables, and other materials
              and items</li>
            <li>Printmaking with rubber stamps, potato shapes, and various other objects </li>
            <li>Working with clay and doughs used for shaping, building, and modeling</li>
            <li>Cutting, tearing, gluing, and stapling</li>
            <li>Shaping/forming and stringing beads</li>
            <li>Creating collages from any combination of fabrics, paper, pictures, and a variety of threedimensional items </li>
            <li>Building 3-dimensional constructions using boxes, paper tubes, cartons, and other
              recyclable materials</li>
            <li>Creating pictures or structures using wire, clay, wood and other materials</li>
          </ul>
