      <h1>FAQs for Parents</h1>

      <button class="accordion">How is discipline approached at WUNS? </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>The	staff	and	director	at	WUNS	work	to	maintain	a	very	positive	and	nurturing	environment	
          for	each	child. The	staff	is	trained	to	anticipate	potentially	problematic	situations;	they	remind	children	of	
          appropriate	behavior	and	redirect	or	intervene	when	necessary. In	most	cases,	teachers	can	
          stop	or	re-direct	behavior	before	something	negative	occurs. If	not, teachers	will	first	consult	
          the	injured	party	to	make	sure	they	are	emotionally	and	physically	okay.	Then,	they	will	turn	
          their	attention	to	the	child	who	might	need	more	support	in	“keeping	their	friends	safe”	or,	
          more	likely,	“keeping	their	bodies	safe”	with	others. When	inappropriate	behavior	is	a	continuing	problem,
          the	school	will	work	with	parents	to	understand	the	issue	and	make	appropriate	recommendations.

      <button class="accordion">How are parent-teacher conferences held?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p> The	school	has	two	Parent	Conferences	during	the	school	year.	The	fall	conference	is	an
          informal,	getting-to-know-the-child-and-family	discussion.	The	spring	conference	includes a	
          more	detailed,	written	assessment.	A	parent-teacher	conference	can	be	scheduled	at	any	
          time	during	the	year	as	needed	and	by	request	of	parents	and/or	teachers.

      <button class="accordion">How does orientation day look like?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          This	visiting	day	is	usually	the	day	after	Labor	Day	and	gives	the	child	and	parent(s) an	
          opportunity	to	visit	the	classroom	and	meet	the	teachers	and	classmates.		This	visit	is	one	
          hour.		It	will	allow	time	for	the	child	to	enjoy	free	play	and	also	gives	parent(s) a	brief	
          overview	of what	to	expect	during	the	school	year. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The	next	day, a	child	will	attend school on	his/her own	(either	Wednesday	or	Thursday,	see	
          orientation	schedule).		The	class	is	divided	in	half,	attending	on	either	Wednesday or	
          Thursday.		This	schedule	allows	the	children	and	teachers	to	interact	with	a	small	group	
          before the	entire	class	attends	on	Friday
        </p>
      </div> 

      <button class="accordion">How do I reach the staff at WUNS?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Communication	is	ongoing	throughout	the	year.		Newsletters,	the	school	website	and	emails	
          give	you	information	on	current	themes,	activities	and	upcoming	events.		Phone	calls	and/or	
          emails	by	classroom	teachers	to	discuss	your	child’s	adjustment,	observations	and/or	
          concerns	are	common.		If	you	feel	you	need	to	speak	to	a	teacher	or	the	director,	please	email	
          or	call	the	office.		Teachers	can	be	reached	by	phone	or	email	after	the	school	day	is	over.

      <button class="accordion">What is the procedure of giving a referral for children with special needs at WUNS?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          It	is	the	policy	at	the	nursery	school	that	after	school	is	underway	and	teachers	have	had	time	
          to	observe	children	in	the	classroom,	a	teacher	who	feels	help	is	needed	in	understanding	the	
          behavior	of	a	child	in	the	classroom	will	ask	the	director	to	come and	observe.	After	
          reviewing	our	observations,	we	schedule	an	appointment	with	the	parents	to	discuss	the	
          school	behavior.	In	the	course	of	that	meeting,	we	may	request	that	a	community	
          professional	evaluate	the	child	in	the	classroom.	This	observation	may	result	in	a	request	for	
          further	evaluation.	If	needed,	community	facilities	that	better	serve	the	child’s	needs	may	be	
          recommended	to	the	parents.

      <button class="accordion">My child needs some extra help adapting and learning. What can WUNS teachers do?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          The teachers at Washington University Nursery School observe and assess children’s progress on
          an ongoing basis. Teachers consistently plan and adapt experiences within the curriculum to
          meet students’ needs.
          If one or more children need help in a specific area, the curriculum may be adapted in a variety
          of ways, which may include:
          <ul>
            <li>Offering more one-on-one teacher-student time to understand the child’s thinking
              process, build trust, and increase student confidence </li>
            <li>Offering more opportunities for exploration</li>
            <li>Simplifying an activity by removing stimuli </li>
            <li>Expanding an activity by adding components for exploration</li>
            <li>Appealing to different senses and ways of exploring materials than previously used in
              order to engage different parts of the brain in the learning process</li>
            <li>Planning individual, small group, and/or large group activities around a particular
              concept, skill, or area of concern</li>
          </ul>

      <button class="accordion">My child has allergies. What is WUNS' precaution?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          If	your	child	has	a	known	allergic	reaction,	this	must	be	documented	on	the	child’s	History	
          and	Health	Record	kept	in	his/	her	file	in	the	office.		Also,	please	report	these	allergies	to	the
          classroom	teachers.		For	your	child’s	safety,	these	allergies	will be	posted	in	your	child’s	
          classroom.		If	you	object	to	this	information	being	posted,	please	contact	the	director.		In	case	
          of	severe	allergies	such	as	to	bee	stings or	nuts,	an	EpiPen	Injector	Kit	may	be	kept	at	the	
          nursery	school	and	used	by	the	director	and/or	teachers	who	are	trained	in	its	
          administration.		This	is	stored	in	the	emergency	backpack in	the	child’s	classroom.		Each	
          classroom	has	a	First	Aid	Kit	that	includes	the	EpiPen	(if	required).		This,	along	with	
          emergency	medical	forms	for	every	child,	accompanies	the	classes	on	all	walking	or	driving	
          field	trips.

      <button class="accordion">What is WUNS' response to accidents?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          The	nursery	school	makes	every	effort	to	ensure	the	safety	of	all	children.		However,	should	a	
          serious	accident	occur,	a	parent	is	immediately	contacted.		If	parents	and	emergency	contacts	
          cannot	be	reached,	we	will	take	your	child	to	the	hospital	designated	on	your	enrollment	
          form.		Minor	injuries	will	be	reported	to	you	by	your	child’s	teacher	at	pick-up.	All	injuries	
          will	also	be	reported	in	written	form	and	given	to	you	at	pickup	time.	We	will	ask	you	to	sign	
          an	identical	form	to	be	placed in	your	child’s	file	at	school.
